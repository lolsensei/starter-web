Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN!

No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Might want to play a bit hard to get.

Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN!

No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Might want to play a bit hard to get.

I don't see how they couldn't just keep it as it was. How hard is it to remember 911? Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss. I'm going to murder you... You bloody woman!

I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! No, no there you go, no there you go. I just heard it come on. Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on.

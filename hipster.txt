Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN!

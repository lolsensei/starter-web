We meet at a time of tension between the United States and Muslims around the world - tension rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate. More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Too many tears have flowed.

It's not because John McCain doesn't care. All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed (peace be upon them) joined in prayer.
